## Welcome to the 4180Balancer Project!
'Created by John Lee, Nyle Malik, and Austin Lowe'

Below you can find a description of a balancing robot designed for ECE 4180 at Georgia Tech.

The web page should explain the project idea, provide instructions, code, and hardware setups so that anyone could recreate your project along with photos and videos along with team member names. It might make sense to have a longer video on the web page (since presentation time is so short). Documentation somewhat like a notebook page can be added in Github. Be sure to setup Github so that a password logon is not needed to view the site. I will no longer be able to host project web sites here, since OIT is demanding I use a lot less space on web pages. Other strange web hosting sites are not allowed. Web pages submitted later than one day after the final will be considered late and points will be deducted from the project grade.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/4180balancer/4180balancer.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/4180balancer/4180balancer.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
