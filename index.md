# Welcome to the 4180Balancer Project!
`Created by John Lee, Nyle Malik, and Austin Lowe`

Below you can find a description of a balancing robot designed for ECE 4180 at Georgia Tech.
Use the following sections to view or recreate our project.

## Project Idea

This project was inspired by Mark William's [Success with a Balancing Robot using a Raspberry Pi](http://ozzmaker.com/success-with-a-balancing-robot-using-a-raspberry-pi/) with major changes in parts used, complexity of design, and how the motors are driven. The general idea was to design a mobile robot with a tall base that will adjust its wheel speeds to stay upright. Our design incorporated learnings and parts from previous labs within 4180 itself, such as the use of a dual H bridge motor driver, IMU, and a Raspberry Pi, as well as new concepts developed in Mark William's project, including work with a PID controller and encoders. The combination of effort led to what we call the 4180Balancer.
